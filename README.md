<img style="float: right;" src="mswr-cover.png">

This is the Github repository for the book [_Modern Statistics with R_](http://www.modernstatisticswithr.com), available at http://www.modernstatisticswithr.com. It is free to use, and always will be. Printed copies are available where books are sold.

The past decades have transformed the world of statistical data analysis, with new methods, new types of data, and new computational tools. The aim of [_Modern Statistics with R_](http://www.modernstatisticswithr.com) is to introduce you to key parts of the modern statistical toolkit. It teaches you:

- __Data wrangling__ - importing, formatting, reshaping, merging, and filtering data in R.
- __Exploratory data analysis__ - using visualisations and multivariate techniques to explore datasets.
- __Statistical inference__ - modern methods for testing hypotheses and computing confidence intervals.
- __Predictive modelling__ - regression models and machine learning methods for prediction, classification, and forecasting.
- __Simulation__ - using simulation techniques for sample size computations and evaluations of statistical methods.
- __Ethics in statistics__ - ethical issues and good statistical practice.
- __R programming__ - writing code that is fast, readable, and (hopefully!) free from bugs.

The book includes plenty of examples and more than 200 exercises with worked solutions.
